			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			The intended purpose of this website is to act as a tool and a resource that can help people understand the quest in a game called Escape From Tarkov. An Overview of Escape from Tarkov is a survival-based game where you have to progress through maps repeatedly, collecting items and escaping successfully to keep those items. Part of going into these maps is to do these quests, and they can be pretty complex. I need you to go to particular spots on the map. It currently has over 200 quests in the games, which take hundreds of hours to complete. The focus is to give people a tool to research these quests and help them plan how to tackle them even before the quests are given. The intended audience is the player base for Escape from Tarkov.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>As I've stated, the intended audience is the current Tarkov player base. To be more specific, the I, the intended audience, is often the ones who are focused on reaching the end of Tarkov or searching for specific quest lines to complete. It's like trying to build a searchable, functional Wikipedia for these players. Yet the focus is more than just general information about the game but the quest lines.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>So one of the goals is to implement a search function like we had in our recipe books so that they can look up the name of the quest or other key elements to match those factors. The other is to add a filter button so it can show multiple quests that meet the same criteria so that they can maybe look at a whole quest line from one person who gives those quests. Another filter requirement is for an action to complete the game called Kappa which is just which is a high end goal. If I get the time the additional optional option is to make this operate off a database that's already public just using JavaScript but that depends if I can get it to work.</p>
