			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			The intended purpose of this website is to act as a tool and a resource that can help people understand the quest in a game called Escape From Tarkov. An Overview of Escape from Tarkov is a survival-based game where you have to progress through maps repeatedly, collecting items and escaping successfully to keep those items. Part of going into these maps is to do these quests, and they can be pretty complex. I need you to go to particular spots on the map. It currently has over 200 quests in the games, which take hundreds of hours to complete. The focus is to give people a tool to research these quests and help them plan how to tackle them even before the quests are given. The intended audience is the player base for Escape from Tarkov.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>As I've stated, the intended audience is the current Tarkov player base. To be more specific, the I, the intended audience, is often the ones who are focused on reaching the end of Tarkov or searching for specific quest lines to complete. It's like trying to build a searchable, functional Wikipedia for these players. Yet the focus is more than just general information about the game but the quest lines.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>So one of the goals is to implement a search function like we had in our recipe books so that they can look up the name of the quest or other key elements to match those factors. The other is to add a filter button so it can show multiple quests that meet the same criteria so that they can maybe look at a whole quest line from one person who gives those quests. Another filter requirement is for an action to complete the game called Kappa which is just which is a high end goal. If I get the time the additional optional option is to make this operate off a database that's already public just using JavaScript but that depends if I can get it to work.</p>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
            <p>The home page will just have these main quest givers so that they can click on an individual 1 and it will still take him to page 2 but immediately filter for that quest giver only and all their quest. It will give us sort explanation what the site's goal is to do and how to use it and what you can look up. And then we'll put a search bar at the bottom so that if they don't click on the page button, they can type search and it'll bring them to page 2.

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>The second page will just be a search engine essentially in the sense how we did it with the recipe data. The grateful thing is I'll have a reference to the information where I'm pulling it from is an open source database for the game that allows you to generate queries. For that query I'll have a data page that we can export and just use as the search engine.</p>
            <a href="referpage.js">JS of all the Quests</a>
            <a href="https://api.tarkov.dev/">The Query Site from the open source project of Tarkov Dev</a>
            <a href="https://tarkov.dev/api/"> Tarkov Dev API Page</a>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
                So for the home page the principal is the top section is just an explanation of how this site works that you can Click to filter automatically by the trader you click on or you can scroll to the bottom and search what you're looking for. Or explained you can Click to the second page to begin your search or filter.
			</p>
			<img src="image/home.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
                So we have two separate bars. One is the search, and the other would be like a list of standard filters they would want to go through, which would be traders' required quest to get to the end of the game or unlock a specific trader. As you see in the boxes, they represent what a search would generally look like. We will show the quest name of the trader that's giving it. They all have images associated with them, so we'll display the image. Like the list of tasks that they're asked to complete, which will provide a challenge because you would need to adjust the box size because some quests have a lot of requirements. Then we'll display the rewards, which can come in two forms: items given to barters unlocked, meaning you can buy stuff from a trader now, or things you can craft.
